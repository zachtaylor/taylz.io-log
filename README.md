# taylz.io/log

An opinionated log library

### Global scope is removed

Protects client in cases of reference shadowing

### Automatically cite line numbers

Calls to write methods record their call stack parent

### Enhanced log levels, color scheme

Added log level `Out`, *above* level `Error`

This is easier to follow, and doesn't impact other log messages
